# About

This is a copy of the group project that I worked on for DSCI 100: Introduction to Data Science. Our group used the K-NN classification algorithm to make predictions whether a red wine is of good or bad quality using measurements of their volatile and fixed acidity. The data set can be found here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality. The project was made in R.
